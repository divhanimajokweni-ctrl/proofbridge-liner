## Release Summary

ProofBridge Liner Safety Kernel v1.0 is now publicly released under Class A classification. This research-grade system release establishes a canonical circuit-breaker pattern for tokenized real-world assets, frozen at the safety-critical layer with complete documentation for independent evaluation.

## What Is Included

### Core System (Safety Kernel v1.0)
- **CircuitBreaker.sol**: 109-line smart contract with full test coverage (14/14 passing)
- **Prover Pipeline**: IPFS-based document verification system
- **Operations Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring interface
- **Deployment Infrastructure**: Foundry scripts for Polygon Amoy

### Documentation Suite
- **Class A Release Specification**: Formal system definition and scope
- **Regulatory Reading Guide**: Compliance and supervisory orientation
- **Regulator Q&A Anticipation Sheet**: Prepared responses for regulatory dialogue
- **Integration Guide**: Technical implementation for developers
- **Economic Models**: 3-year cost projections and equity analysis
- **Risk Event Memo**: Hypothetical scenario documentation

### Business Artifacts
- **Issuer Term Sheet**: Commercial integration terms
- **Strategic Positioning**: Competitive analysis vs. Chainlink
- **Task Report**: Complete project execution summary

## Problem Solved

Tokenized real-world assets create "ghost-risk": the risk that on-chain tokens continue trading after their legal backing has silently changed off-chain. ProofBridge Liner prevents this by halting transfers when legal uncertainty is detected.

## Key Characteristics

### Safety Kernel Invariants (Frozen)
- Transfers must halt when legal truth is uncertain
- Reset authority exclusive to issuer (human oversight preserved)
- Oracle cannot transfer, mint, burn, or seize assets
- Enforcement gas-bounded and deterministic

### Trust Model
- Single oracle MVP (upgradeable to threshold consensus)
- Explicit access controls and event logging
- Fail-closed enforcement philosophy
- No automatic circuit resets (issuer discretion required)

### Economic Model
- Zero-fee integration at adoption
- Marginal operational cost <$0.05 per asset per month
- Equity-carry alignment (1% of protected assets)
- No token issuance or subscription fees

## Verification & Reproducibility

All claims are supported by executable artifacts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/divhanimajokweni-ctrl/proofbridge-liner.git
cd proofbridge-liner
```

## Intended Audience

- **Tokenized Asset Issuers**: Evaluate integration feasibility
- **Smart Contract Engineers**: Review implementation patterns
- **Risk & Compliance Teams**: Assess regulatory implications
- **Protocol Researchers**: Study ghost-risk mitigation approaches
- **Infrastructure Partners**: Explore integration opportunities
- **Regulators & Auditors**: Conduct technical review

## Forward Compatibility

Future releases may introduce:
- Multi-oracle threshold consensus
- Hardware-backed key custody
- Registry integrations
- Multi-jurisdiction legal adapters

All future work will be versioned separately and will not alter v1.0 behavior.

## Canonical Statement

> **ProofBridge Liner does not attempt to prove legal truth on-chain. It prevents the market from trading when legal truth is uncertain.**

## Release Declaration

By publishing this release, the authors declare that:

- The Safety Kernel v1.0 is frozen and will not be modified
- All included artifacts are complete and independently verifiable
- No hidden dependencies or undisclosed trust assumptions exist
- The release is complete within its declared scope
- Future development will occur under new version numbers

## Next Steps

### For Evaluation
- Review the [Class A Release Specification](class-a-release-spec.md)
- Examine the [CircuitBreaker.sol](contracts/CircuitBreaker.sol) implementation
- Run the test suite and deployment scripts

### For Integration
- Consult the [Integration Guide](integration-guide.md)
- Review the [Issuer Term Sheet](issuer-term-sheet.md)
- Evaluate the [Economic Models](economic-models.md)

### For Further Development
- Class B: Protocol publication with live testnet deployment
- Phase 5: Institutional adoption with audit and formal security review
- Production: Audited mainnet deployment

## Disclaimer

This is a research-grade release for evaluation purposes. It does not constitute investment advice, legal opinion, or production deployment. Users should conduct their own technical, legal, and regulatory due diligence.
