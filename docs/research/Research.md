Abstract

This essay documents the complete decision chain behind the ProofBridge Liner MVP — a circuit‑breaker oracle for tokenized real estate. Over a compressed planning cycle, the project confronted a critical architectural divergence: remain with a 72‑hour, hook‑first, real‑estate‑specific circuit breaker, or pivot to a four‑week, general‑purpose attestation platform built on Base with AWS Nitro enclaves. The analysis that follows demonstrates why the Liner architecture was preserved, how the pivot was systematically evaluated and rejected, and what executable code resulted. The essay serves as both a strategic artefact and a reproducible derivation of the final CircuitBreaker.sol contract and its Foundry test suite.

1. Introduction: The Ghost‑Risk Problem

Tokenized real estate — pioneered by issuers such as RealT and Propy — enables fractional property ownership on‑chain, settling trades in milliseconds. The legal deed that underpins ownership, however, remains an off‑chain artefact, modifiable through conveyance, lien, or clerical correction over days, weeks, or months. The on‑chain token may continue to circulate while the deed hash it references has become stale. This temporal mismatch creates ghost risk: a token whose legal backing has silently diverged from its on‑chain representation.

No existing oracle infrastructure monitors this gap. Chainlink’s market‑dominant price feeds solve numeric consensus; Nautilus’s TEE compute targets verifiable off‑chain execution. Neither offers a structured product for legal‑document attestation with circuit‑breaker enforcement.

ProofBridge Liner was conceived to fill this gap.

---

2. The Ratified Liner Architecture

2.1 Core Thesis

Instead of building a new attestation platform, Liner inserts a minimal circuit breaker into the existing ERC‑20 token. The issuer adds a five‑line _beforeTokenTransfer override that calls a shared CircuitBreaker contract. When an off‑chain prover detects that the IPFS‑stored deed hash no longer matches the expected value, the circuit trips, and all transfers of that property’s token revert. Trading halts until the issuer reconciles on‑chain and off‑chain state.

The value proposition is deliberately narrow: stop trading when the deed drifts. Simplicity is the product.

2.2 Ratified Design Decisions

In a formal meeting, the following choices were locked as binding:

Dimension Decision Rationale
Vertical Real estate Deeds are binary‑hashable PDFs; private credit defaults require legally contested processes unresolvable by a deterministic oracle.
Integration _beforeTokenTransfer hook Zero switching cost; no token migration.
Network Polygon (Amoy → mainnet) Low gas fees; existing RealT token presence.
Oracle trust (MVP) Single trusted address + onlyOracle modifier Enables rapid deployment; threshold signature verification deferred to Week 2.
Witness model Human lawyer updates IPFS CID Trust anchor at concept stage; registry APIs post‑PMF.
Sprint duration 72 hours Forces demonstrable output before over‑engineering.

2.4 Sprint Dependency Chain

```
Phase 0: Environment → Phase 1: Contracts & Tests → Phase 2: Deploy (Amoy)
                         → Phase 3: Prover (fetcher + submitter)
                         → Phase 4: Mock Quorum (tss-signer + Docker)
                         → Phase 5: E2E Demo
                         → Phase 6: Ghost Audit + Issuer Pitch
```

No phase begins before its predecessor is verified.

3. The Divergence: “ProofBridge Core” Execution Protocol

3.1 The New Proposal

Immediately after the Liner architecture was ratified, a separate execution protocol was introduced under the name ProofBridge Core. It replaced the circuit‑breaker hook with a general‑purpose AttestationRegistry.sol, targeted the Base network, and extended the timeline to four weeks.

3.2 Structural Comparison

Dimension ProofBridge Liner (Ratified) ProofBridge Core (Proposed)
Primary Contract CircuitBreaker.sol — circuit‑breaker hook AttestationRegistry.sol — generic attestation storage
Integration _beforeTokenTransfer in existing ERC‑20 REST API layer; no explicit token hook
Trust Model Single oracle → SafeKrypte HSM AWS Nitro TEE + 2‑of‑3 enclave quorum
Vertical Lock Real estate deeds Generic RWA documents
Network Polygon Amoy Base Sepolia
Sprint Length 72 hours 4 weeks
Moat Source Ghost‑risk audit specificity Hardware‑attested infrastructure generality

3.3 Implication Analysis

The Core plan is not a refinement — it is a category shift from a vertical‑native risk‑mitigation tool to a horizontal attestation platform. It abandons the hook‑first GTM (zero switching cost for issuers) in favor of infrastructure that issuers must adopt as a new dependency. It defers demonstrable output by four weeks, during which the team would build enclave quorum logic before proving any market demand.

---

4. Strategic Rebuttal: Why the Pivot Was Rejected

4.1 Speed and Demonstrability

Liner produces a pitch‑ready, on‑chain demo in 72 hours. At the end of that sprint, the project holds a deployed contract, a recorded trip video, and a ghost‑risk audit on real properties. These artefacts open issuer conversations. Core’s four‑week trajectory builds infrastructure (Nitro enclaves, quorum coordination, REST API) that delivers no issuer‑facing proof until completion. The posture is “build it and they will come” — risky when trust is won by exposing risk, not offering platforms.

4.2 Adoption Friction

Liner asks issuers for five lines of Solidity they can audit in seconds. Core asks them to integrate an external attestation registry and API. The difference in adoption friction is existential: one is a conversation starter; the other is a procurement decision.

4.3 Specificity as Competitive Moat

Liner derives defensibility from specificity. By auditing RealT’s live property deeds before any competitor, ProofBridge creates proprietary intelligence about ghost‑risk exposure. That audit becomes the basis for equity‑carry arrangements (“free hook, 1% equity carry on attested assets”). Core’s generic attestation schema, by contrast, places ProofBridge in competition with established oracle networks — Chainlink Proof of Reserve, Nautilus TEE compute — whose infrastructure scale dwarfs a concept‑stage project.

4.4 Trust Model Maturation Path

Core’s AWS Nitro quorum is technically sophisticated but premature. MVPs exist to validate demand, not harden infrastructure. Liner’s explicit upgrade path — SafeKrypte SK‑1 HSM as oracle key custodian — provides a commercially viable, auditable trust anchor without self‑managing an enclave cluster. The capital allocation logic is clear: prove the economic model before hardening the infrastructure, not the reverse.

---

5. Decision: Persevere with Liner

The following verdict was rendered:

The Liner sprint is preserved. The Core protocol contains useful artefacts (attestation‑schema.json, TEE‑quorum concepts) that will be extracted into docs/future‑architecture.md for post‑PMF consideration. No meeting minutes are amended. No network switch to Base occurs unless an issuer demands it.

The analysis concluded that a preemptive pivot before testing the Liner thesis would represent engineering a solution to a problem not yet validated — precisely the pattern the 72‑hour sprint was designed to prevent.

6. Derivation of the Final CircuitBreaker.sol Contract

6.1 Design Constraints

1. Single oracle address (onlyOracle modifier) — no threshold signature verification at MVP.
2. No dead parameters: the thresholdSig field present in an earlier draft was removed from updateProof.
3. validate reverts when the circuit is tripped (whenOpen modifier) to enforce transfer halts.
4. Reset restricted to contract owner (issuer), not the oracle.
5. Upgradeable initialization pattern (OpenZeppelin Initializable).

6.2 State Machine

```

                        │  CIRCUIT OPEN   │

                            │         │
                  updateProof()   tripCircuit(reason)
                            │         │

7. Foundry Test Suite Derivation

7.1 Coverage Matrix

The test suite was designed to exercise every modifier (onlyOracle, whenOpen) and every function under both valid and adversarial conditions:

Function Happy Path Adversarial
updateProof Oracle updates, event emitted Non‑oracle caller reverts
tripCircuit Oracle trips, event emitted Non‑oracle caller reverts
validate Open + match = true; Open + mismatch = false Tripped circuit reverts
reset Owner resets, event emitted Non‑owner reverts
initialize Sets owner, oracle, circuitOpen —

All adversarial cases use vm.expectRevert with explicit error messages.

9. Conclusion

The ProofBridge Liner architecture survived a rigorous confrontation with an alternative proposal and emerged reinforced. The decisions to remain vertical‑specific, hook‑first, and time‑boxed to 72 hours are grounded in a clear hierarchy of priorities: demonstrability over infrastructure ambition; issuer adoption simplicity over platform generality; and specific ghost‑risk intelligence over horizontal schema design.

The executable artefacts — CircuitBreaker.sol and its comprehensive Foundry test suite — have been successfully implemented and tested. The Safety Kernel v1.0 is frozen, representing a complete, deployable system for ghost-risk mitigation in tokenized real estate. The off‑chain prover pipeline is operational, and Class A publication artifacts are ready for release.

ProofBridge Liner has achieved its thesis: ship the hook, prove ghost‑risk exists, and establish credibility through code rather than promises. The project now transitions from research implementation to market validation, with frozen invariants that enable confident issuer conversations.
